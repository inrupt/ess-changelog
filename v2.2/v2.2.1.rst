v2.2.1
======

*Released 2024-03-19*


v2.2.1 Access Grants
--------------------


Updates
~~~~~~~

* Breaking change. To allow an operator to restrict which clients can issue and revoke Access Credentials by type, the ``INRUPT_VC_CLIENT_ID_ALLOW_LIST`` has been removed and replaced with (**now required**) client allow lists based on  particular Access Credential type : ``INRUPT_VC_CLIENT_ID_ALLOW_LIST_SOLIDACCESSREQUEST`` and ``INRUPT_VC_CLIENT_ID_ALLOW_LIST_SOLIDACCESSGRANT``.  With this change, a new overlay input file ``ess-verifiable-credentials-client-type-allow-list.env`` has been added for setting the **now required** configurations. See :ref:`2.2.1-ag-service-client-allow-lists` and :ref:`2.2.1-inputs-changes`.
